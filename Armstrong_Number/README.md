***An Armstrong number is an n-digit number in which the sum of the nth power of its digits is equal to the number itself. 
For example, 370 is an Armstrong number. Here number of digits is 3 so n=3.Since 3*3*3 + 7*7*7* + 0*0*0 = 27 + 343 + 0 = 370 = 370
For example, 22 is not an Armstrong number. Here number of digits is 2 so n=2. Since 2*2 + 2*2 = 4 + 4 = 8 != 22
