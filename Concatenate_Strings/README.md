**We are given a problem to concatenate one string into other. So before moving ahead lets briefly understand the concept of string.**

In C, String is array of characters terminated by a NULL character (‘\0’).  We don’t place the NULL character in the end of string but C compiler automatically sets the ending byte when we initialize the array.

There are two ways to concatenate two strings. One with using string.h  string library and other with out using  string.h  string library.
